Immunichain Guided Tour
=======================

**What is Immunichain?**

Immunichain is the tracking of immunization records of a child on the blockchain. The participants in the network include: a guardian, a medical provider and a member organization (think of summer camp or a high school athletic department). Between these participants, we are granting or revoking access to the child's immunization record. If you are a medical provider and have access to the child's immunization record, you can administor new immunizations. Additionally, if you are a member, you can view the child's immunization record if you have access to it. Why would we grant access for a member to our child's immunization record? Well, for example, each summer millions of kids go to summer camp. Tradtionally, each summer camp needs to verify that the child has had all their shots. In today's world, the guardian or the doctor has to fill out a form explaining that the child has had all their immunization shots. In tomorrow's world, we can utilize blockchain to not only stop having to fill out paper forms of maybe incorrect information, but we can simply allow the member to view the records and - once approved - we can revoke their access so that they don't keep the child's information.  

**How did Immunichain Come About?**

Immunichain came from an IBM internal Blockchain hackathon in May of 2017. Around the same time, an Open Mainframe Project intern Kevin Lee from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was tasked to use this use case to make a blockchain application. He ended up making this application that you are going to use today. 

The use case is a true story for on of our co-workers, as her grandson lived in 3 different countries before coming to the US. Transferring her grandson's medical records took a very long time due to the complications of the US law and information the other 3 countries were providing. While the medical records were being transferred, her grandson ended up having the same immunization shots multiple times - which can be harmful to the child. They finally were able to get the medical record transferred to a US doctor and the child is doing well today. While the original intent of this use case was for children, you can think of doing a similar use case with pets and their shot records. 

**What are you going to accomplish today?**

Today, you will take a guided tour of the Immunichain UI. This UI will allow you to create a guardian, medical provider and a member organization. Once you have a guardian you can create a child (it's that simple...) and grant access to your medical provider and member organzations. Based on whether or not you have granted access or revoked access, the participants will be able to administor new immunization shots or read the child's immunization record. Underneath this UI, is the blockchain network doing all the work for you through REST API calls. If you took this to your friend, they should not even know that blockchain is doing all the work underneath the covers. In a real world application, Immunichain would be split up into 3 different UI's comprised of our 3 participants.

Part 1: Create your Participants & Child
========================================

1. Begin by going to the Immunichain UI::

    https://immunichain.zcloud.marist.edu/login/
  
2. Click on ``Create an account``

3. You will be prompted to fill out a profile for your participant. In the ``Role`` field, select your participant (Guardian, Healthcare Provider and Member Organization). Based on your role, fill out the rest of the information. 

**NOTE:** You will want to make your profile specific to you. As everyone is creating their participant, it is being inserted into one database. By the time you create your participants, there could be multiple medical providers and member organizations. If you make them specific to you, you will know which medical provider and member organiation to assign to your child. 

Here is my guardian:

4. Once you have successfully created a guardian, you will be welcomed with the guardian's homepage

.. image:: images/2.png

5. Once you have looked through the available options for our guardian, you can click on ``logout`` in the top right

6. Once you are on the Immunichain homepage, you can click on ``Create an account`` once more. This time, make a healthcare provider

Here is my healthcare provider:

.. image:: images/3.png

7. Once you have made your healthcare provider, you will be graced with its profile

.. image:: images/4.png

8. Once you have looked through the available options for our healthcare provider, you can click on ``logout`` in the top right

9. Once you are on the Immunichain homepage, you can click on ``Create an account`` once more. This time, make a member organization

Here is my member organization:

.. image:: images/5.png

10. Once you have made you member organization, you will be greeted with its profile

.. image:: images/6.png

11. Look through the available options for our member organization. Once you are finished, you can click on ``logout`` in the top right

Part 2: Create a Child and Grant Access
=======================================

1. You should be on the Immunichain homepage. If you are log into your ``guardian``

.. image:: images/7.png

2. Once you get to your guardian's profile, scroll down and click on ``Continue`` of ``Add a Child``

3. Fill out the information for our hypothetical child and choose the healthcare provider and member organization that you created

**NOTE** Remember how I said - at the beginning - that there would be multiple healthcare providers and members to choose from, you now know why I said to make the participants specific to you. 

.. image:: images/8.png

4. Click on ``Submit`` once you have filled out your child's information

.. image:: images/9.png

5. Click on ``return home`` and that should take you back to the guardian's profile. Now that you think you have create a child, you can confirm by click on ``Continue`` of ``View Record``

6. Select our new child and click on ``Continue``

7. You should now see all the information you just filled in for our child

.. image:: images/10.png

8. You will notice that we have already granted access for our healthcare provider, Suzie, and then our member organization, KennysCamp. 

If you did not grant access for our other participants when creating the child, you will see blank information in the ``Medical Providers`` and ``Member Organizations`` section. You can change that by going to the guardian's profile and then click on ``Authorize Member`` or ``Add Medical Provider``

Part 3: Add Immunizations
=========================

1. Navigate your way back to the Immunichain homepage. Once you are there, log into our member organization

.. image:: images/11.png

2. Click on ``Continue`` of the ``View Record`` tile

3. You should only see the children in which we have access to - in this case, it should only be ``BabyDennis``

.. image:: images/12.png

4. Click on ``Continue`` and you should see all of Dennis's information

.. image:: images/13.png

5. You will notice, that there are no immunization shots on Dennis's record. Let's change that. We can do that by logging out of our Member and then logging into our Healthcare Provider

.. image:: images/14.png

6. Once you get to the medical providers homepage, click on ``Continue`` of ``Add Immunization``. Then select our child, ``Dennis``.

7. You should now be on the screen to add immunizations for Dennis. Go ahead and give Dennis an immunization shot with today's date

.. image:: images/15.png

8. Go ahead and click on ``Submit`` to add this immunization shot. Once you have done that, you will should see a ``Success`` message

.. image:: images/16.png

9. Now that we have successfully added an immunization shot, we can see if our member can see it on their end. You can do that by logging out of the healthcare provider and then logging into our member.

10. Once you are on the member's profile, you can click on ``Continue`` of the ``View Record`` tile and selecting Dennis.

11. Now that we have selected Dennis, you can see see the updated information of Dennis's immunization shot

.. image:: images/17.png

12. Imagine if you were a SummerCamp or another member participant that needs childrens medical shot record. Doing this digital increases the accuracy of the data due to the healthcare provider inputting the data right when the shot was administered. Additionally, this will allow them to increase their efficency of approving children into their camp, for example. 

Now if you were a guardian and a summer camp already approved your child, we would want to revoke that member from seeing our child's immunization record. How do we do that? We will do exactly that in the next section.

Part 4: Revoking Access
=======================

1. Navigate back to Immunchain's homepage and log into the Guardian's profile

2. Click on ``Continue`` of the ``Deauthorize Member`` tile

3. Select Dennis as our child and then select our Member, KennysCamp, as the one we revoking access to

.. image:: images/18.png

4. You should get a ``Success`` message once click on ``Submit`` of the revoking our member

.. image:: images/19.png

5. Now, log out of our guardian and log into our medical provider

6. Once in the medical provider's profile, click on ``Continue`` of the ``Add Immunization`` tile

7. Select our child, Dennis, and then add another immunization to his record

.. image:: images/20.png

8. Once you get the ``Success`` message, click on ``Back to Home``. 

9. You should still be in the guardian's profile. Since you are, click on ``Continue`` of the ``View Record`` tile. Then select our child, Dennis. You should then see Dennis's updated immunization record

.. image:: images/21.png

10. Log out of our medical provider and then log into our member, KennysCamp. 

11. Click on ``Continue`` of the ``View Record`` tile. You should see the message of: ``You do not have any children``. This means the KennysCamp can't view Dennis's immunization record anymore. 

.. image:: images/22.png

Optional: If you want to grant KennysCamp as a member again, you can go back into the guardian's profile. Once there, you can click on ``Continue`` of the ``Authorize Member`` tile. Then you can grant KennysCamp as an authorized member for Dennis. Now if you go back to KennysCamp, click on ``Continue`` of the ``View Record`` tile and you should see the updated information for Dennis.

**End of Lab**

Summary
=======

In this guided lab of Immunichain, you created 3 different participants: a guardian, a medical provider and a member. Then having created a guardian, we create a child. Using our child, Dennis, we added immunization shots and showed that from the members perspective. Knowing that our member could see the immunization record, we revoked their access to the medical record. We did that by going to the guardian perspective and deauthorizing the member. To reconfirm that we revoked the member's access to the immunization record, we went back to our member and saw the message saying that we ``Don't have any children`` meaning that KennysCamp wasn't authorized to see anyone's medical record. 

Moving forward, what ways do you think you could improve this blockchain network? How would insurance effect this network? What missing components do you think would benefit this network?
